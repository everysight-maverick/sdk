# Maverick Simulator

In this folder, you'll find various releases of the Maverick simulator, with each simulator emulating a specific firmware version of Maverick Glasses.

The structure of the simulator folders is organized as `Firmware[Firmware Version]/[Simulator Version]`. Within each folder, you'll find three simulator files, each built for one of the supported operating systems:

| File | OS| Minimum Supported Version
|--|--|--|
|MaverickSim119.exe|Windows|x64, Windows 10
|MaverickSim119.dmg|MacOS|Arm, Ventura
|MaverickSim119|Linux|Ubuntu 20.04



More information about the simulator can be found in the [simulator page](https://everysight.github.io/maverick_docs/sdk-engine/simulator/) in the developer portal.
